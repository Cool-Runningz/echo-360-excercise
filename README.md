This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## React Task  ##

Implement a React component that will receive an array of options:
```javascript
  [
    { label: 'Label 1', value: 1 },
    { label: 'Label 2', value: 2 },
    { label: 'Label 3', value: 3 },
    { label: 'Label 4', value: 4 }
  ]
```

And then render a set of radio buttons with the corresponding labels and values. Changing the radio button selection should update a value in a second, containing component's state and display that value on the page.


## CSS Task ##

Given the HTML markup:
```html
<button class="checkout-btn">
  checkout
</button>
```

Without changing the HTML, make the button look reasonably similar to the screenshot. It doesn't have to have pixel-perfect measurements. The colors used are: `lightsteelblue`, `steelblue`, `white` and `darkslategray` and the font is whatever sans-serif floats your boat.
